# Sketch Internals
The raw dumps of Sketch internals for different versions of Sketch â€” useful for Sketch Plugin developers to keep track of the hidden nooks and crannies of the app runtime.

## Usage
Go checkout the headers for production versions [here](https://github.com/ryngonzalez/Sketch-Internals-Documentation/blob/master/dumps/production), and the beta dumps [here](https://github.com/ryngonzalez/Sketch-Internals-Documentation/blob/master/dumps/beta).

## Contributing
1. Go download `class-dump` from [here](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/) and add it to your path.
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/class-dump /usr/local/bin
```
2. Use `make` to generate headers, or do it manually yourself using `class-dump`.
#### Production
```bash
